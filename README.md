# CS210-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In CS210, I completed multiple C++ programming projects that simulated real-world software tasks.  
One major project was the **ChadaTech Clock Project**, where I created a program that displayed both 12-hour and 24-hour clocks and allowed the user to update hours, minutes, and seconds. This solved the problem of providing a clear, interactive time display while practicing modular code design and input handling.

Another project was the **Corner Grocer Program**, which processed a text file of purchased items and generated a frequency list and histogram. This program solved the problem of helping a small business track purchasing trends by automating daily item-count data.

Together, these projects helped reinforce foundational C++ skills, including classes, functions, loops, file I/O, and data structures.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did well organizing my code into clean, reusable functions and classes.  
The ClockProject demonstrated strong modular design, with each time-adjusting function separated for clarity.  
In the Corner Grocer Program, I used a map effectively to count item frequencies and generate accurate output.  
I also followed best practices, such as meaningful naming, comments, and breaking the program into manageable steps.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your program more efficient, secure, or effective?
I could enhance my code by adding more user input validation to prevent incorrect entries from crashing the program.  
For the Corner Grocer project, improving error handling around file operations would make the program more robust.  
The ClockProject could be improved by adding formatting functions to handle edge cases more cleanly and by reducing repetition in the menu logic.

These improvements would make my software more reliable, user-friendly, and maintainable.

# What did you find challenging while working on your project, and how did you overcome it?
One major challenge was working with file input/output and maps for the Corner Grocer project, especially when reading data and updating frequency counts.  
I overcame this by testing my file logic with smaller inputs and printing debugging statements to verify each step.

For the ClockProject, managing time rollovers (such as when seconds or minutes exceeded 59) required careful logic.  
I overcame this by breaking the problem down and testing each function individually in Visual Studio.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
This course strengthened several critical programming skills, including:

- Modular design using classes and functions  
- Debugging with Visual Studio  
- Working with file streams  
- Using maps and vectors to store and process data  
- Understanding loops, conditionals, and program flow  
- Writing clean, readable, maintainable code  

These skills transfer directly to future coursework in data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and any real-world programming job.

I also learned how to think through problems step-by-step and test my logic, which is essential for success in any software development environment.
